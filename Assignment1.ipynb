    "#### **Q1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:     *    : Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "     'hello' : String\n",
    "     \n",
    "     -87.8   : Float\n",
    "     \n",
    "       -     : Operator\n",
    "       \n",
    "       /     : Operator\n",
    "       \n",
    "       +\t : Operator\n",
    "       \n",
    "       6     : Interger\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Q2. What is the difference between string and variable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: **String** are character enclosed in quotes of any type - single quotation marks, double quotation marks and triple quotation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable** represent named location that refers to a value and whose value can be used and processed during program run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Q3. Describe three different data types.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: **String** - String data type lets you hold string data in a set of quatation marks. \n",
    "Eg:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"abcd\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Assignment\"\n",
    "\n",
    "'Python'\n",
    "\n",
    "**List** - List represent comma-separated values of any datatype between square brackets. List can be changed(i.e mutable).\n",
    "Eg. following are some lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1,2,3,4]\n",
    "\n",
    "[\"a\",\"e\",\"i\",\"g\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "[\"maths\",\"english\",\"science\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuple** - Tuples cannot be changed. It is a group of comma seperated values of any datatypes within parenthesis.\n",
    "e.g - following are some tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "p=(1,2,3,4,5)\n",
    "\n",
    "q=(2,4,6)\n",
    "\n",
    "r=(\"A\",\"B\",9,6)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Q4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. All expression is evaluated and returns the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Q5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Assignment statements is used to assign the objects to names. Like value 10 is assigned to variable named \"spam\".\n",
    "\n",
    "“expression” is a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value.\n",
    "Eg. type(spam) is an expression, which calls function \"type\" and returns value \"int\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to a “statement” which is just a standalone unit of execution and doesn't return anything.\n",
    "like spam=10 is an assigment statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Q6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?**\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: bacon variable contain int value 23.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Q7. What should the values of the following two terms be?**\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: 'spam' + 'spamspam' : 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "     'spam' * 3          : 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Q8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Because in Python a variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character. A variable name cannot start with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Q9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: For integer - int(), floating point number - float() and string - str()\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Q10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Because + operator has to have all operands of same type either of number or string type. It cannot work with one operand as string and one as a number\n",
    "It can be fix as : 'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'"
